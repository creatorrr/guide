# if...else

The `if...else` conditional expression returns one of two values based on a condition. It looks like this:

```text
if (condition) {
  value1
} else {
  value2
}
```

There are some rules that will be enforced:

* The `else` branch must be present, if it's missing you will get a syntax error. This ensures you handle all possibilities.
* The `condition` must evaluate to type `Bool`.
* The values of both branches **must evaluate to the same type**

Currently there is no shorthand for a conditional expression.

#### else if ...

Multiple `if..else` statements can be written in sequence:

```text
if (number > 5) {
  true
} else if (number > 2 {
  true
} else {
  false
}
```
